"""Claude Code judgment layer: caption writing and output review.

Division of labor: Python does everything deterministic (frame extraction,
prompts, parsing, validation); Claude Code — running headless on the
subscription OAuth token (`claude setup-token` → CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN,
or an interactive login on a dev machine) — does the judgment: reading
the frames, deciding what the video shows, wording the caption, and
reviewing the rendered result.

You are a professional TikTok editor reviewing a finished vertical

Read (view) these frames, sampled in chronological order from the

The first frame listed IS the video's opening (the cold-open hook).

Check, strictly:
1. Any expected caption is fully visible, legible, and not covering the
   action (skip this check when there is intentionally no caption).
2. The opening frame works as a scroll-stopping hook (action, not setup).
3. The content itself is readable/judgeable at phone size.
4. The final frame ends on something worth seeing (not a desktop/cutoff).

The editor can fix: caption text, caption position, output length,
hook on/off, auto-zoom on/off. It cannot increase source resolution or
re-record. Say "redo" ONLY for problems those controls can fix; put
source-quality limitations in "notes" instead.

You are the assistant of a TikTok auto-editor. The creator reviewed the
rendered video and wants changes. Map their feedback onto the editor's
settings.

Current edit settings:

Session history (what was already tried):
{history}

The creator's feedback: "{feedback}"

Available settings:
- caption: the on-video caption text (max {max_chars} chars, specific,
  no hashtags/quotes, no policy-risky wording, max one emoji at the end)
- regenerate_caption: true when they want a different caption but didn't
  provide the text themselves
- target: output length in seconds (10-120); shorter = faster pacing.
  Unset means automatic (a TikTok-friendly ~30s solved from the
  content) — only set it when the creator asks about length/pacing
- caption_pos: "auto" (calmest spot), "top", "bottom"
- style: caption look — "purple" (purple on white, the default),
  "yellow" (black on yellow), "black" (white on black)
- hook: cold-open teaser of the best beat (true/false)
- crop: auto-zoom into the action, dropping static margins (true/false)
- zoom: framing dial, a number — 1.0 = auto framing; higher zooms
  tighter into the action, lower pulls wider. Adjust in steps of about
  0.15-0.3 from the current value ("closer"/"tighter"/"can't read it"
  goes up, "wider"/"too cropped"/"show more" goes down; range 0.5-2.5)
- look: finishing color grade — contrast/saturation pop, crisper text
  (true/false; "too saturated"/"flat colors" feedback maps here)
- keep_audio: keep the original ambient sound (default is muted)
- music: "synthwave", "phonk", or "off" (baked-in generated music)
- music_bpm: tempo of the backing track in BPM (60-180). Phonk sits
  ~132, synthwave ~84; the current value is in the settings above. Raise
  it for "faster/quicker/more hyped" music, lower it for "slower/chill".
  Only set this for tempo feedback, not for video pacing (that's target)
- new_music_mix: true when they want a different/fresh track in the same
  style ("another beat", "different track", "remix it")
