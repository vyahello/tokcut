"""Claude Code judgment layer: caption writing and output review.

Division of labor: Python does everything deterministic (frame extraction,
prompts, parsing, validation); Claude Code — running headless on the
subscription OAuth token (`claude setup-token` → CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN,
or an interactive login on a dev machine) — does the judgment: reading
the frames, deciding what the video shows, wording the caption, and
reviewing the rendered result.

Read (view) these frames, sampled in chronological order from the
FINISHED video:

{caption_note}
The first frame listed IS the video's opening (the cold-open hook).

Check, strictly:
1. Any expected caption is fully visible, legible, and not covering the
   action (skip this check when there is intentionally no caption).
2. The opening frame works as a scroll-stopping hook (action, not setup).
3. The content itself is readable/judgeable at phone size.
4. The final frame ends on something worth seeing (not a desktop/cutoff).

The editor can fix: caption text, caption position, output length,
hook on/off, auto-zoom on/off. It cannot increase source resolution or
re-record. Say "redo" ONLY for problems those controls can fix; put
source-quality limitations in "notes" instead.

- regenerate_caption: true when they want a different caption but didn't

- caption_pos: "auto" (calmest spot), "top", "bottom"
- style: caption look — "purple" (purple on white, the default),

- hook: cold-open teaser of the best beat (true/false)
- crop: auto-zoom into the action, dropping static margins (true/false)
