# ✂️🎬 tokcut

### raw phone clip in → scroll-stopping TikTok out

*Shoot a long, messy clip, let `tokcut` cut the boring bits, slap on a clean
caption, and drop a beat underneath — ready to upload.*

An auto-editor that turns raw phone footage into tight, high-quality
vertical TikTok clips. 🎯 Motion analysis drives speed-ramps (boring stretches
fast-forwarded ⏩, action kept real-time ▶️), a persistent styled caption is
auto-placed where it won't cover the action 🏷️, and the export is **muted by
default** 🔇 so you add a trending TikTok sound in-app (optional synthesized
music if you want it baked in).

Works for any talking-to-camera, screen-recording, tutorial, vlog, or
process video where there's dead time to trim and a moment worth keeping. 🎬

## ✨ What it does for you

| | |
|---|---|
| ⏩ **Kills dead air** | Fast-forwards the parts where you're just reading docs; keeps the payoff at 1x |
| 🏷️ **Smart captions** | Purple-on-white sticker text, auto-placed over the calmest part of the frame so it never hides your screen |
| 🛡️ **Won't get you flagged** | Warns about wording TikTok's moderation tends to penalize before you post |
| 🔇 **Ready for in-app sound** | Exports silent by default so you tap a trending TikTok sound — or bake in royalty-free music with `--music` |
| 📱 **Phone-grade quality** | 1080×1920, 10-bit HEVC, iPhone HLG color preserved — survives TikTok's re-encode |

## 📦 Install

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"   # needs ffmpeg + DejaVu/Noto fonts on the system
```

System requirements: `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` with libx265, fonts
`fonts-dejavu` + `fonts-noto-color-emoji`.

## 🚀 Use

```bash
# preview the cut plan (instant, no encode)
tokcut clip.MOV -c "How I set this up ⚡" --target 50 --dry-run

# render — muted by default, you add a trending sound in TikTok
tokcut clip.MOV -c "How I set this up ⚡" --target 50

# keep your original ambient audio instead of muting
tokcut clip.MOV -c "How I set this up ⚡" --target 50 --keep-audio

# bake in a synthesized phonk track (for off-platform posts)
tokcut clip.MOV -c "How I set this up ⚡" --target 50 --music --music-style phonk

# or your own audio file
tokcut clip.MOV -c "..." --music ~/tracks/mytrack.mp3
```

(`python -m tokcut ...` works too if you didn't `pip install`.)

> 💡 **Pro tip:** always `--dry-run` first — it prints the cut plan
> (which seconds get fast-forwarded vs kept) in a fraction of a second,
> so you can dial in `--target` before committing to a multi-minute encode.

## ⚙️ How it works

1. **Probe** the source (dimensions/rotation/fps/duration/audio).
2. **Motion analysis** — decode tiny grayscale frames at 6 fps, score by
   mean frame-to-frame difference.
3. **Classify** the timeline into dead / lag / action tiers (adaptive
   percentile thresholds; short runs merged so cuts feel intentional).
4. **Editorial cuts** — cold-open **hook** on the strongest beat,
   hard-trim boring lead-ins/outros (open and close on action), and
   **auto-zoom** into the action when static margins waste the frame.
5. **Speeds** — action 1x, lag ≈1.7x, dead ≈3.2x; `--target N` solves the
   fast-tier speeds to land at N seconds.
6. **Caption** — Pillow renders purple bold-italic on rounded white boxes
   (emoji supported). A saliency map places it over the calmest region
   inside TikTok's UI safe zone, so it never covers the screen/device.
7. **Audio** — muted by default (silent export for in-app TikTok sound).
   `--keep-audio` retains the original ambient; `--music` bakes in a
   royalty-free synthwave/phonk track synthesized by `tokcut.music` (zero
   copyright risk) — and since the track's beat grid is known exactly,
   every cut is **snapped onto the beat** 🥁.
8. **Render** — one ffmpeg `filter_complex`: per-segment trim/setpts +
   atempo, concat, optional crop, lanczos scale into 1080x1920, caption
   overlay, encode **libx265 main10 crf 18** with color tags matched to
   the source (HLG/PQ for HDR, bt709 for SDR).

## 🧪 Develop

```bash
venv/bin/pytest          # run tests
venv/bin/ruff check .    # lint
venv/bin/mypy            # type-check (codebase is fully typed)
```

## 🤖 Telegram bot

📱 Phone → private Telegram bot → **Claude writes the caption, the bot
renders, Claude reviews** → file back with **✅ Approve / 🔁 Redo**. Redo in
plain words ("shorter", "caption at the top", "add phonk music") and Claude
maps it to settings for the next revision. Claude Code runs on your
subscription OAuth — see [`docs/BOT.md`](docs/BOT.md) to run it and
[`docs/BOT_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/BOT_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the design.

```bash
pip install -e ".[bot]"          # adds python-telegram-bot
cp .env.example .env             # fill in token + your Telegram id
tokcut-bot
```

For full-length clips over Telegram's 50 MB cap, run a local Bot API server
(`docker compose -f docker-compose.botapi.yml up -d`) and set
`TOKCUT_BOT_API_URL` — it lifts the limit to 2 GB. See [`docs/BOT.md`](docs/BOT.md).

## 🗺️ Roadmap

VPS deploy (the CI stage is stubbed and waiting). Big clips already work —
point the bot at a local Bot API server — and music cuts are beat-aligned.
See [`docs/IDEAS.md`](docs/IDEAS.md) for the content playbook.
